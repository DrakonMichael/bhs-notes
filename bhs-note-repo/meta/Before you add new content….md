## Before you add new content…
To maintain some sort of internal consistency, there are a couple rules for adding new notes or changing old ones:

To make the wiki, we use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and we maintain versioning through Git. 

---

##### Plugins:
Required:
» **Admonition** – This is so that admonition code blocks appear properly
» **Obsidian Git** – Self explanatory

Recommended:
» **Note Refactor**
» **Smart Typography**

These plugins should be installed by default when installing this repo, however, they may not install correctly. 

```ad-note
title: Note location
Note location should be formatted in a way that is logically consistent. ALL notes MUST be in the ./Notes directory and MUST be in a subject folder. The other stuff is left as an exercise to the maintainer of that subject.

Please attempt to keep consistency in a subject. For subjects that have multiple teachers, because they have vaguely similar content by virtue of the AP curriculum, make sure that there is no duplicate content and all notes related to a specific topic/event/person/location/etc is located in the same file. For instance, for `multiplication`, a sane location would be 

Notes » Math » Topics » multiplication
```

Once you make a contribution, make sure to add your name to the respective list under `meta/Contributors - {subject}`, and your name will automatically appear in the contriubtor list for the related subject.

Thank you for taking part in this project.
