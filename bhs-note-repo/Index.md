**Hey new maintainers,**
This is a completely new note repo, so please take a moment to read:

This wiki is a large collection of notes that were collected by both the class of 2023 and 2024. The purpose of these notes is to give those who either did not make notes or whose notes were not adequate enough to do well in the class a chance.

The data here is structured as a wiki — all of the data is interconnected and everything leads back to where it came from (Such is the idea, at least.) This is because data is rarely linear, and in some subjects is closer to a web of information. 

So far we support **2** classes, and a full list is written below:
- [[APUSH/Index|AP United States History]]
- [[Accelerated Precalculus/Index|Accelerated Precalculus]]

This wiki will be avaliable either for download via the [Git Repository](https://github.com/DrakonMichael/bhs-notes) or for online access via [Obsidian Publish](tbd)
